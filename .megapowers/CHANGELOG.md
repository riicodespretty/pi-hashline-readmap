# Megapowers Session Changelog

## Issue #001: Project Scaffold — CLOSED ✅
**Date**: 2026-02-26

### Delivered
- Full TypeScript pi extension scaffold (`pi-hashline-readmap`) unifying source from:
  - `pi-hashline-edit@0.3.0` (hashline read/edit/grep)
  - `pi-read-map@1.3.0` (structural file maps)
  - `pi-rtk@0.1.3` (bash output techniques)
- 33 passing Vitest tests across 8 test files
- `tsc --noEmit` exits 0, `npm test` exits 0
- All 17 acceptance criteria verified

### Side effects on later issues
- **#002 (import hashline-edit)**: Fully completed by #001 scaffold — close as duplicate
- **#003 (import readmap mapper)**: Fully completed by #001 scaffold — close as duplicate
- **#011 (import RTK techniques)**: Fully completed by #001 scaffold — close as duplicate
- **M4 tasks**: RTK source files are already in `src/rtk/`, only wiring (#012) and tests (#013) remain

### Learnings captured
7 learnings saved to `.megapowers/plans/001-project-scaffold/learnings.md`

## Issue #014 (Batch): M1 Core Integration — Map into Read Tool — CLOSED ✅
**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Source Issues**: #004 (integrate map into read tool), #005 (update read prompt), #006 (unit and integration tests)

### Delivered
- `src/map-cache.ts`: mtime-keyed in-memory cache (`getOrGenerateMap`, `clearMapCache`) — AC-1.1–AC-1.7
- `src/read.ts`: truncated reads (no offset/limit) now append `formatFileMapWithBudget()` structural map section; all map errors silently swallowed — AC-2.1–AC-2.7
- `index.ts`: wired `registerReadTool`, `registerEditTool`, `registerGrepTool` in default export — AC-3.1–AC-3.3
- `prompts/read.md`: updated to document map output, 17-language support, mtime caching, targeted-read usage — AC-4.1–AC-4.5
- Test fixtures: `tests/fixtures/small.ts`, `large.ts`, `small.py`, `sample.bin`, `plain.txt` — AC-5.1–AC-5.5
- 60 tests across 12 test files, all passing; `tsc --noEmit` exits 0

### Changelog (for CHANGELOG.md)
```
## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `read` tool accepts optional `map: true` parameter to append structural map for any file, even small ones; mutually exclusive with `symbol` (#039)
- `grep` tool accepts optional `summary: true` parameter returning `[N matches in M files]` header + per-file counts sorted descending, no hashline anchors (#039)
- `grep` tool appends `[Results truncated at N matches — refine pattern or increase limit]` when results hit the limit in both normal and summary modes (#039)
- `prompts/sg.md` expanded with 7 additional pattern examples (class, if, try-catch, arrow functions, JSX, async) and a 7-entry Tips & Common Pitfalls section (#039)
- `prompts/read.md` symbol table expanded with 4 new symbol type examples: interface, type alias, const/variable, enum (#039)
- Map cache module (`src/map-cache.ts`) with mtime-keyed cache for FileMap results (#004)
- Structural map appended to truncated reads in `src/read.ts`; map failures are silent (#004)
- All three tools (read, edit, grep) wired in `index.ts` default export (#004)
- Updated `prompts/read.md` to document map output, 17 languages, mtime caching (#005)
- Test fixtures (small.ts, large.ts, small.py, sample.bin, plain.txt) and 27 new tests (#006)
```
✅ All three wrap-up actions complete:

1. **write-changelog** — Appended entry to `.megapowers/CHANGELOG.md` documenting all deliverables from issues #004, #005, #006 (source `CHANGELOG.md` is write-protected in done phase, so the entry is staged in `.megapowers/CHANGELOG.md` ready to be applied when write access is restored).

2. **capture-learnings** — 7 bullet-point learnings saved to `.megapowers/plans/014-m1-core-integration-map-into-read-tool-p/learnings.md` covering: silent-catch discipline, mtime cache simplicity, real-file tests over mocks, fixture sizing, parallel task ordering, formatter edge-case handling, and arity smoke tests.

3. **close-issue** — Issue #014 and all three source issues (#004, #005, #006) marked `status: closed` in `.megapowers/issues/`. (The phase is already at terminal `done` — no further phase transitions are available.)

### Summary of what shipped

- **#023** — `edit` write-path now catches `EACCES`/`EPERM` and returns `"Permission denied: <path>"` (was: unhandled Node error)
- **#024** — `read` prepends a bare-CR warning header when `\r`-only line endings are detected (was: silent mismatch with ripgrep)
- **#030a** — `edit` reads as Buffer first and rejects NUL-byte files with `"Cannot edit binary file: <path>"` (was: silent corruption)
- **#030b** — Anchor mismatch errors include `"Did you mean?"` similarity suggestions in `LINE:HASH|content` format when anchor carries content (was: no guidance)
- **#030c** — `compactDiff` preserves all `+`/`-` lines, compresses context to 3/side, default cap 100, configurable, with `... +K more changes` truncation indicator (was: hard-capped at 10 hunk lines / 50 total)

**218 tests pass, 0 failures.**

### Action 4: close-issue

Historical wrap-up note from the original #039 work session:

---

## Partial wrap-up note — Issue #039

The original implementation session shipped these completed pieces of #039:
- `read` tool: `map: true` parameter appends structural map for any file on demand
- `grep` tool: `summary: true` parameter for per-file match counts; truncation indicator at result limit
- `prompts/sg.md`: expanded examples + Tips & Common Pitfalls section
- `prompts/read.md`: expanded symbol examples

Post-audit correction (2026-03-16): issue #039 was **not fully completed**. The following scope remains open in `.megapowers/issues/039-read-grep-sg-agent-ux-enhancements.md`:
- multi-file read support
- directory listing mode for `read`

The original PR/branch history is still valid historical context, but #039 should remain open until those remaining read-tool UX items are implemented.

## Issue #052: Escape control characters in hashlined tool output — CLOSED ✅
**Date**: 2026-03-16
### Fixed
- Escaped raw ASCII control characters in `read`, `grep`, and `sg` hashlined output so copied tool output no longer breaks downstream JSON tool calls (#052)
- Preserved anchor stability by keeping hash computation on raw line text and applying escaping only in display formatting (#052)
- Escaped related control-character previews in hashline mismatch diagnostics and edit no-op diagnostics (#052)
### Tests
- Added regression coverage for `read`/`grep`, `sg`, `hashLines()`, `hashLine()`, mismatch diagnostics, and edit diagnostics
- Verified with `npm test` → 71 passing files / 388 passing tests

## Issue #053: Expose PTC-native structured results from read/grep/sg/edit — CLOSED ✅
**Date**: 2026-03-16
### Added
- Added stable additive `details.ptcValue` payloads to `read`, `grep`, `sg`, and `edit` so downstream PTC consumers can use structured results without parsing human-formatted text (#053)
- Added shared structured line helpers in `src/ptc-value.ts` to preserve consistent `{ line, hash, anchor, raw, display }` semantics across line-oriented tool payloads (#053)
- Documented the `PTC structured output` schema contract in `README.md` for downstream consumers (#053)
### Tests
- Added dedicated regression coverage for `read`, `grep`, `sg`, and `edit` ptcValue payloads, including metadata, truncation alignment, and noop/warning cases
- Verified with `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` → 76 passing files / 399 passing tests

## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Refactored `read`, `grep`, `sg`, and `edit` so chat text and `details.ptcValue` are projected from shared internal output builders while preserving existing hashlines, warning behavior, truncation behavior, and raw-content anchor semantics (#055)
## Issue #054: Add PTC tool policy contract metadata — CLOSED ✅
**Date**: 2026-03-17
### Added
- Added `HASHLINE_TOOL_PTC_POLICY` and `getHashlineToolPtcPolicy()` as a canonical, machine-readable PTC policy contract for `read`, `grep`, `sg`, and `edit` (#054)
- Re-exported the PTC policy contract and related types from the package root so downstream consumers can import it programmatically without prose parsing (#054)
- Documented recommended PTC exposure tiers in `README.md`, including optional downstream consumption by `pi-prompt-assembler` without introducing a runtime dependency (#054)
### Tests
- Added dedicated regression coverage for the canonical contract, package-root export, and README policy documentation
- Verified with `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` → 79 passing files / 402 passing tests

## Issue #056 (Batch): Hashline + PTC Native Integration — CLOSED ✅
**Date**: 2026-03-18
**Source Issues**: #053 (ptcValue payloads), #054 (PTC metadata), #055 (shared IR)
### Added
- Inline runtime `ptc` metadata on `read`, `grep`, `sg`, `edit` tool definitions with callable/policy/pythonName/defaultExposure fields, backward-compatible with legacy `enabled`/`readOnly` (#056)
- Runtime metadata discovery in pi-ptc-next ToolRegistry — discovers hashline tool eligibility from active tools' inline `ptc` metadata instead of hard-coded contracts (#056)
- Active tool override execution — nested `code_execution` calls the hashline implementations directly when overrides are active (#056)
- `details.ptcValue` passthrough in pi-ptc-next — structured values returned to Python unchanged without text parsing (#056)
- `defaultExposure: "opt-in"` gating — `sg` requires explicit `PTC_CALLABLE_TOOLS` inclusion (#056)
- `read` Python helper expanded with `symbol` and `map` keyword arguments (#056)
- Full TypedDict models: `ReadResult`, `GrepResult`, `SgResult`, `AnchoredEditResult`, `EditNoop` (#056)
- Live contract tests for read/grep/sg/edit that fail if TypedDict or README examples drift from real payloads (#056)
- Real interop harness: sg → read(symbol) → edit → grep through CodeExecutor against actual pi-hashline-readmap (#056)
### Fixed
- Flaky `CustomToolManager` reload test — added polling fallback (mtime+size signatures at 250ms) for when `fs.watch` drops events (#056)
- Policy drift-guard test now cross-checks `read.defaultExposure` alongside grep/sg/edit (#056)
- Indentation fix on `reconcileFile` closing brace in pi-ptc-next (#056)
### Tests
- pi-hashline-readmap: 87 files, 419 tests, 0 failures
- pi-ptc-next: 70 tests, 0 failures (up from ~55)
