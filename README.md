A drop-in [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) extension that replaces the stock `read`, `edit`, `grep`, and `sg` tools with a unified toolset built for reliable agent coding. It also compresses noisy `bash` output so more context budget goes to code.

## Why use this instead of the stock tools?

### Safer edits

Stock read/search output is easy for a model to paraphrase or drift from. This package returns **`LINE:HASH|content` anchors** so follow-up edits target the exact line that was read:

```text
45:e4|router.addRoute("/api", handler);
```

Fewer accidental wrong-line edits, better resistance to file drift, more reliable surgical changes.

### Better navigation on large files

Reads can append a **structural map** showing classes, functions, methods, and line ranges — so the agent sees the shape of a file instead of scrolling blind.

### Direct symbol lookup

Instead of hunting with offsets:

```ts
read({ path: "src/server.ts", symbol: "handleRequest" })
read({ path: "src/router.ts", symbol: "Router.addRoute" })
```

Cuts tokens and reduces exploratory round-trips.

### Search results that are immediately editable

`grep` and `sg` output is hashline-anchored, so the agent can go straight from search to edit without a cleanup read in between.

### Semantic edit classification

After each successful edit, the result includes a `semanticSummary` in the structured output (`details.ptcValue.semanticSummary`) that classifies the change as `semantic`, `whitespace-only`, `mixed`, or `no-op`. This helps agents and reviewers quickly assess whether a change is substantive or cosmetic.

When [difftastic](https://difftastic.wilfred.me/) (`difft`) is installed, classification uses AST-aware diffing for more accurate results — especially for detecting moved code blocks and formatting-only changes. Without difftastic, the tool falls back to internal line-level heuristics. Install with:

```bash
brew install difftastic
```

### Less wasted context on noisy command output

`bash` outputs from test runners, builds, git, linters, Docker, package managers, and more are compressed to the parts that matter.

### One package, no overlapping-tool fights

A common pi problem is stacking multiple extensions that all want to own `read`, `grep`, or `edit` — leading to conflict and unpredictable behavior. This package unifies the overlapping improvements into one extension.

## What you get

### `read`

- `LINE:HASH|content` output
- Structural maps via `map: true` — supports **17 languages** (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, C, C++, Clojure, SQL, JSON, JSONL, Markdown, YAML, TOML, CSV)
- Automatic maps on truncated reads
- Symbol lookup via `symbol` param (dot notation for methods: `ClassName.methodName`)
- `map` and `symbol` are mutually exclusive; `symbol` cannot combine with `offset`/`limit`
- Image delegation, binary file detection, display-safe control character escaping
- Custom TUI rendering with symbol/map/warning badges

### `edit`

- Hash-verified anchored edits using `LINE:HASH` anchors from `read`/`grep`/`sg`
- Operations: `set_line`, `replace_lines`, `insert_after`, `replace`
- Compact diff and full diff support
- Mismatch diagnostics with context
- Custom TUI rendering with diff preview

### `grep`

- Hash-anchored match output, ready to feed directly into `edit`
- Context lines with deduped/merged windows
- `summary: true` mode for file-level match counts
- Truncation indicators when results hit the limit
- Custom TUI rendering with match distribution and truncation badges

### `sg`

- Wraps [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/) for structural code search
- Returns merged, hash-anchored match blocks grouped by file
- Ideal for structural search → edit workflows
- Custom TUI rendering
- Requires `ast-grep` installed (`brew install ast-grep`)

### `bash` output compression

Eleven specialized compressors for common command output:

| Compressor | What it handles |
|---|---|
| test-output | Test runner results (vitest, jest, pytest, etc.) |
| build | Build tool output (tsc, esbuild, webpack, etc.) |
| build-tools | Compiler/bundler noise |
| git | Git command output |
| linter | Linter results (eslint, shellcheck, etc.) |
| docker | Docker build/run output |
| package-manager | npm/yarn/pnpm install output |
| http-client | curl/wget output |
| transfer | rsync/scp output |
| file-listing | ls/find/tree output |
| truncate | Smart truncation for oversized output |

ANSI escape stripping runs on all bash output regardless.

## Example workflows

### Read → edit

```text
read({ path: "src/server.ts" })
```

```text
45:e4|router.addRoute("/api", handler);
```

```text
edit({
  path: "src/server.ts",
  edits: [
    {
      set_line: {
        anchor: "45:e4",
        new_text: 'router.addRoute("/api/v2", handler);'
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

### Symbol read

```text
read({ path: "src/server.ts", symbol: "handleRequest" })
```

Returns only that symbol's body, already hashlined and ready for editing.

### Read with a map

```text
read({ path: "src/large-file.ts", map: true })
```

Returns scoped hashlines plus a structural outline of the file.

### Search → edit with grep

```text
grep({ pattern: "addRoute", path: "src", literal: true })
```

```text
[3 matches in 2 files]
--- src/server.ts (2 matches) ---
src/server.ts:>>45:e4|router.addRoute("/api", handler);
```

Use the anchor directly in `edit`.

### Structural search with sg

```text
sg({ pattern: "console.log($$$ARGS)", lang: "typescript", path: "src" })
```

Returns hash-anchored AST matches grouped by file.

## Installation

### From npm

```bash
pi install npm:pi-hashline-readmap
```

### From GitHub

```bash
pi install git:github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap
```

### From a local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap.git
cd pi-hashline-readmap
npm install
pi install .
```

## Requirements

- Node.js **>= 20**
- [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) with extension support

Optional CLI tools for full functionality:

```bash
brew install ast-grep          # required for sg tool
brew install difftastic        # semantic edit classification (optional)
brew install shellcheck yq scc # used by some compressors
```

## PTC structured output

All four tools expose machine-facing structured payloads at `details.ptcValue` alongside their human-facing `content[].text` output:

- **`read`** — path, line range, warnings, truncation info, symbol metadata, map status, per-line anchors
- **`grep`** — summary flag, total matches, per-match records with anchors
- **`sg`** — per-file match ranges and anchored lines
- **`edit`** — ok/fail, summary, diff, changed line, warnings, noop edits

Hashes and anchors are tied to raw file content. `display` fields are escaped for safe rendering; `raw` fields preserve the underlying file text.

### PTC tool policy contract

The package exports a machine-readable policy contract via `HASHLINE_TOOL_PTC_POLICY` and `getHashlineToolPtcPolicy()`:

```ts
import { HASHLINE_TOOL_PTC_POLICY } from "pi-hashline-readmap";
```

- `read` and `grep` are safe-by-default, read-only helpers.
- `sg` is opt-in, read-only.
- `edit` is not safe-by-default and is mutating/write-capable.

`pi-prompt-assembler` may optionally consume this contract, but `pi-hashline-readmap` does not require it to function.

### EventBus integration

On load, the extension emits tool executor references for downstream PTC consumers:

```ts
pi.events.emit("hashline:tool-executors", { read, edit, grep, sg });
```

Also available at `globalThis.__hashlineToolExecutors`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test             # 483 tests across 92 files
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
