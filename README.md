Upgrade pi's local coding workflow with hash-anchored reads and edits, structural file maps, symbol-aware navigation, structural search, agent-friendly file exploration, and compressed `bash` output.

`pi-hashline-readmap` is a drop-in [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) extension. It replaces the stock `read`, `edit`, `grep`, `ls`, and `find` tools, provides an enhanced `ast_search` tool, registers `write`, adds an optional `nu` tool for structured exploration via Nushell, and post-processes `bash` output so more context budget goes to signal instead of noise.

It also reduces extension conflict risk by replacing several overlapping tool packages with one coordinated implementation.

## Why use it?

- Keep edits tied to stable `LINE:HASH` anchors instead of fragile line numbers.
- Navigate large files with structural maps and direct symbol reads.
- Turn search results into edit anchors without an extra read step.
- Search code structurally with `ast_search` when text search is too brittle.
- Explore files with agent-oriented `ls`, `find`, and optional `nu` tools.
- Compress noisy test, build, Git, Docker, linter, package-manager, HTTP, transfer, and generic command output.
- Use one extension instead of stacking overlapping `read`, `grep`, `edit`, and Bash-output packages.

## Installation

### Requirements

- [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) with extension support
- Node.js **>= 20** for local development in this repository

### From npm

```bash
pi install npm:pi-hashline-readmap
```

### From GitHub

```bash
pi install git:github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap
```

### From a local checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap.git
cd pi-hashline-readmap
npm install
pi install .
```

Start a new pi session after installation. Running sessions do not hot-reload extension code or tool registrations.

### Optional local tools

These tools are not required for the extension to load, but they unlock more capability or better output quality:

```bash
brew install nushell           # required for the nu tool
brew install ast-grep          # required for ast_search
brew install fd                # optional, speeds up find
brew install universal-ctags   # optional, symbol maps for languages without a dedicated mapper
brew install difftastic        # optional, improves semantic edit summaries
brew install shellcheck yq scc # optional, improves some bash-output compression paths
```

Dedicated readmap mappers handle TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C, C++, Swift, Clojure, shell, SQL, Markdown, and several data formats (JSON/JSONL/YAML/TOML/CSV) with the highest-quality structural maps. For files outside that set, the read tool's structural map falls back to universal-ctags when it is installed, and to a generic regex-based extractor when it is not. Installing universal-ctags is therefore only worthwhile if you regularly read files in languages without a dedicated mapper (for example Ruby, PHP, Lua, Kotlin) and want symbol-aware maps for them.

### Known npm install warnings

Installing `pi-hashline-readmap` prints a few `npm warn ERESOLVE` lines about `tree-sitter` peer dependencies, plus a `node-domexception@1.0.0` deprecation notice. These are cosmetic and do not break the install.

Why they happen:

- `tree-sitter-cpp` and `tree-sitter-java` (latest published versions) declare `peerOptional tree-sitter@"^0.21.1"`.
- We pin `tree-sitter@0.22.4` because `tree-sitter-rust@0.23.3` requires `^0.22.1`, so we cannot go back to 0.21.x.
- The `overrides` block in our `package.json` resolves this when this repo is the root project, but `overrides` are not honored when we are installed as a dependency, which is what `pi install` does. The grammars work fine against `tree-sitter@0.22.x` at runtime — the peer dep is `peerOptional`, npm just prints the mismatch.
- `node-domexception` is a transitive deprecation, not one of our direct dependencies.

These warnings will go away once `tree-sitter-cpp` / `tree-sitter-java` widen their peer ranges upstream; the `overrides` block can then be removed too.

## 30-second example

The core workflow is: read a file, copy a `LINE:HASH` anchor, and edit against that verified anchor.

```text
read({ path: "tests/fixtures/small.ts" })

# Example output:
45:4bf|export function createDemoDirectory(): UserDirectory {
```

```text
edit({
  path: "tests/fixtures/small.ts",
  edits: [
    {
      set_line: {
        anchor: "45:4bf",
        new_text: "export function buildDemoDirectory(): UserDirectory {"
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

Before writing, `edit` verifies that anchor against the current file contents. If the file changed, it reports a mismatch instead of silently editing the wrong line.

## Common workflows

### Safely edit a line

Use `read` first, then pass the copied anchor to `edit`.

```text
read({ path: "src/example.ts" })
edit({
  path: "src/example.ts",
  edits: [
    { set_line: { anchor: "12:abc", new_text: "const enabled = true;" } }
  ]
})
```

`read`, `grep`, `ast_search`, and `write` all return hashlined output that can feed follow-up edits.

### Create a new file with `write`

```text
write({ path: "src/new-module.ts", content: "export const demo = 1;\n" })
```

`write` creates parent directories automatically and returns hashlined output for immediate refinement.

### Navigate a large file

```text
read({ path: "src/hashline.ts", map: true })
read({ path: "tests/fixtures/small.ts", symbol: "createDemoDirectory" })
read({ path: "tests/fixtures/small.ts", symbol: "UserDirectory.addUser" })
```

Structural maps are appended automatically when large reads are truncated. The readmap supports 18 mapped language/file kinds, including TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, Swift, Shell, C/C++, Clojure, SQL, JSON/JSONL, Markdown, YAML, TOML, and CSV/TSV. Direct symbol reads can target functions, classes, methods, interfaces, type aliases, constants, and enums when the file type is supported.

### Read a symbol with local support

```text
read({ path: "tests/fixtures/small.ts", symbol: "createDemoDirectory", bundle: "local" })
```

Use `bundle: "local"` when you want the requested symbol plus direct same-file local support.

### Search and patch

```text
grep({ pattern: "createDemoDirectory", path: "tests/fixtures", literal: true })
grep({ pattern: "createDemoDirectory", path: "tests/fixtures", literal: true, scope: "symbol" })
grep({ pattern: "createDemoDirectory", path: "tests/fixtures", literal: true, scope: "symbol", scopeContext: 3 })
```

`grep` returns anchored matches, supports literal and regex search, can summarize matches with `summary: true`, and can scope output to enclosing symbols. Use `scopeContext: 0` for only matching lines inside the resolved symbol block.

### Replace a whole symbol

Use `replace_symbol` inside `edit` to swap an entire function, method, or class declaration by name — no anchors needed:

```text
edit({
  path: "src/foo.ts",
  edits: [
    {
      replace_symbol: {
        symbol: "add",
        new_body: "export function add(a: number, b: number) {\n  return a + b + 1;\n}"
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

`replace_symbol` resolves the symbol with the same symbol-query syntax as `read symbol:"..."` for precise in-memory mappers currently registered for TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, and Java. For files with multiple overloads of the same name, append `@<line>` to select the exact declaration:

```text
replace_symbol: { symbol: "Foo.bar@42", new_body: "..." }
```

The new body is automatically re-indented to match the original symbol's leading indentation. After the write, the tree-sitter syntax-regression validator checks for net-new parse errors:

- `warn` (default) — write succeeds; a `syntax-regression` warning is appended.
- `block` — write is aborted with the `syntax-regression` ptc error code.
- `off` — validation skipped.

Set the mode with `PI_HASHLINE_SYNTAX_VALIDATE=block|warn|off`. See [prompts/edit.md](prompts/edit.md) for the full `replace_symbol` contract, supported-language scope, `Class.method@line` disambiguation rules, and error-precedence ordering. See [prompts/read.md](prompts/read.md) for the broader `read symbol:"..."` lookup contract.

### Search code structurally

```text
ast_search({ pattern: "console.log($$$ARGS)", lang: "typescript", path: "src" })
```

`ast_search` wraps local `ast-grep`, returns merged anchored match blocks grouped by file, and is best for syntax-shaped queries rather than raw text matching.

### Explore files

```text
ls({ path: "src" })
find({ pattern: "*.ts", path: "src", maxDepth: 2 })
nu({ command: "open package.json | get scripts" })
```

`ls` shows one directory with directories first and dotfiles included. `find` performs recursive discovery, respects `.gitignore`, includes hidden files, and supports depth, regex, sort, mtime, and size filters. `nu` registers only when Nushell is installed and is useful for structured JSON, CSV, TOML, YAML, and filesystem inspection.

### Handle noisy command output

The extension post-processes `bash` results to reduce noise while preserving useful output. Route-specific compression covers test runners, builds, compilers, Git, linters, Docker, package managers, HTTP clients, transfer tools, file-listing output, and oversized generic output.

Use `PI_RTK_BYPASS=1` when route-specific compression hides something you need:

```bash
PI_RTK_BYPASS=1 npm test
PI_RTK_BYPASS=1 git log --stat
```

`PI_RTK_BYPASS=1` does not disable the Bash context guard; very large raw output can still be replaced with a recoverable preview unless `PI_HASHLINE_BASH_CONTEXT_GUARD=0` is also set. See [docs/bash-output.md](docs/bash-output.md) for the full layered behavior and recovery details.

## Configuration

Most users do not need configuration. Use environment variables when you want to tighten visible grep output budgets, change where structural map caches are stored, disable persistent map caching, tune Bash output recovery, or enable context-hygiene debugging.

| Variable | Purpose | Default / behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `PI_HASHLINE_GREP_MAX_LINES` | Tighten `grep`'s final visible line budget | Positive base-10 integer; invalid/unset values use the built-in default; above-default values are clamped down |
| `PI_HASHLINE_GREP_MAX_BYTES` | Tighten `grep`'s final visible byte budget | Positive base-10 integer; invalid/unset values use the built-in default; above-default values are clamped down |
| `PI_HASHLINE_MAP_CACHE_DIR` | Override the persistent structural-map cache directory | Uses the provided path verbatim |
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | Base directory for the persistent map cache when no explicit cache dir is set | Cache lives under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pi-hashline-readmap/maps` |
| `PI_HASHLINE_NO_PERSIST_MAPS=1` | Disable the on-disk structural-map cache | Keeps caching in-memory only |
| `PI_NUSHELL_CONFIG` | Override the Nushell config path used by `nu` | Otherwise prefers `~/.config/pi/nushell/config.nu`, then `--no-config-file` |
| `PI_RTK_BYPASS=1` | Disable route-specific `bash` compression for one command invocation | ANSI is still stripped; anti-pattern hints still apply; the Bash context guard can still trim oversized output |
| `PI_HASHLINE_BASH_CONTEXT_GUARD=0` | Disable the Bash context guard and original-output restoration layer | Any value other than exact `0` leaves the default-on guard enabled |
| `PI_HASHLINE_BASH_CONTEXT_GUARD_MAX_LINES` | Tighten the post-RTK Bash guard line budget | Positive base-10 integer; invalid/unset values use `2000`; above-default values are clamped down |
| `PI_HASHLINE_BASH_CONTEXT_GUARD_MAX_BYTES` | Tighten the post-RTK Bash guard byte budget | Positive base-10 integer interpreted as raw bytes; invalid/unset values use `51200`; above-default values are clamped down |
| `PI_HASHLINE_BASH_CONTEXT_GUARD_HEAD_LINES` | Tighten the guarded preview head size | Positive base-10 integer; invalid/unset values use `80`; above-default values are clamped down |
| `PI_HASHLINE_BASH_CONTEXT_GUARD_TAIL_LINES` | Tighten the guarded preview tail size | Positive base-10 integer; invalid/unset values use `120`; above-default values are clamped down |
| `PI_CONTEXT_HYGIENE_DEBUG=1` | Register the debug-only `context_hygiene_report` read-only tool | Disabled unless explicitly set to `1` |

### PTC tool policy contract

The package exports `HASHLINE_TOOL_PTC_POLICY` and `getHashlineToolPtcPolicy()` for integrations. In that contract, `read`, `grep`, `ls`, and `find` are safe-by-default and read-only; `ast_search` and `nu` are opt-in and read-only; `edit` is not safe-by-default and is mutating. `pi-prompt-assembler` may optionally consume this contract when deciding which helpers to expose.

## EventBus integration

On extension load, the executor map is emitted with `pi.events.emit("hashline:tool-executors", toolExecutors)` and also assigned to `globalThis.__hashlineToolExecutors`. The core executor surface includes `read`, `edit`, `grep`, `ast_search`, `write`, `ls`, and `find`, plus `nu` when Nushell is available at runtime.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Validate the workspace:

```bash
npm test
npm run typecheck
```

Release candidates should also pass an npm package dry run:

```bash
npm pack --dry-run
```

Before publishing or opening a PR, run the workspace checks above from a clean checkout.

This repository is intended to be used as a pi extension workspace. New agent sessions pick up local extension edits from the checkout, but running sessions do not hot-reload the module graph. Restart the agent session after changing extension code.
