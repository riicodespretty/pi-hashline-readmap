# pi-hashline-readmap

A unified [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) extension that replaces five built-in tools (`read`, `edit`, `grep`, `sg`, `bash` output) with enhanced versions — hash-anchored editing, structural code maps, AST-grep integration, and intelligent bash output compression. One extension, zero conflicts.

## Why

Several popular pi extensions each register overlapping tools. Only one `read` tool can win — whichever loads last overwrites the rest. You had to choose between:

- **Hash-anchored editing** — content-addressable lines (`LINE:HASH|`) for drift-proof surgical edits
- **Structural file maps** — AST-based symbol tables for navigating large codebases
- **AST-grep search** — structural code search with hashlined output
- **Bash output compression** — smart filtering of test/build/git/linter output

This extension combines all four into a single package. Everything works together, nothing conflicts.

## Features

### 🔗 `read` — Hash-anchored file reading + structural maps + symbol lookup

Every line is prefixed with a `LINE:HASH|` anchor:

```
1:a3f|import { readFile } from "node:fs";
2:b71|import { resolve } from "node:path";
3:05|
4:c2e|export function loadConfig(path: string) {
```

**Structural maps on large files** — when a file is truncated (>2000 lines or >50KB), a structural map is automatically appended:

```
[Showing lines 1-2000 of 5432. Use offset=2001 to continue.]

## File Map
- class EventEmitter (lines 1-245)
  - method on (lines 12-45)
  - method emit (lines 47-89)
- class DatabaseConnection (lines 250-890)
  - method connect (lines 255-310)
  - method query (lines 312-450)
```

Maps support **17 languages** including TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, C/C++, Java, Clojure, SQL, YAML, TOML, Markdown, and more. Maps are cached in memory by file modification time.

**Symbol-addressable reads** — jump directly to a function or class by name:

```
read("src/server.ts", { symbol: "handleRequest" })
→ returns just that function, hashlined, with [Symbol: handleRequest (function), lines 45-89 of 500]

read("src/server.ts", { symbol: "Router.addRoute" })
→ dot notation for methods inside classes
```

### ✏️ `edit` — Hash-verified surgical edits

Use `LINE:HASH` anchors from `read` or `grep` output to make precise, atomic edits:

- `set_line` — replace or delete a single line
- `replace_lines` — replace a range
- `insert_after` — insert after an anchor
- `replace` — global string replace (fallback)

Hash verification ensures edits target the exact line you intended — no drift, no surprises.

When an edit changes a single line, the diff is compact:

```
45:e4|  router.addRoute("/api", handler); → 45:f9|  router.addRoute("/api/v2", handler);
```

Multi-line edits use the full unified diff format.

### 🔍 `grep` — Hash-anchored search

Search results come with `LINE:HASH|` anchors, ready to feed directly into `edit`. Every result opens with a summary header and per-file match counts:

```
[3 matches in 2 files]
--- src/server.ts (2 matches) ---
src/server.ts:>>45:e4|  router.addRoute("/api", handler);
src/server.ts:>>89:2c|  router.addRoute("/health", ping);
--- src/client.ts (1 match) ---
src/client.ts:>>12:7d|  const router = new Router();
```

When total matches exceed 50, each file is capped at 10 shown matches with a `... +K more matches` footer. When `context > 0`, overlapping context windows from adjacent matches are merged — each source line appears at most once — and non-adjacent groups are separated by `--`.

Supports regex patterns, literal search, glob filtering, case-insensitive mode, and context lines.

### 🌳 `sg` — AST-grep with hashlined results

Structural code search using [ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/) — find code by AST pattern, not raw text:

```
sg({ pattern: "console.log($$$ARGS)", path: "src/" })

--- src/debug.ts ---
>>12:a3|  console.log("request", req.url);
>>45:f1|  console.log(error.message, error.stack);
```

Overlapping or adjacent match ranges (gap ≤ 1 line) are merged before output, so each source line appears at most once. All results come with hash anchors for direct use with `edit`.

### 📦 Bash output compression

Automatically intercepts `bash` tool results and applies intelligent compression:

| Output type | What it does |
|------------|-------------|
| **Test runners** (vitest, jest, pytest, go test) | Extracts pass/fail summary, shows only failures |
| **Build tools** (tsc, esbuild, cargo, go build) | Extracts error count and diagnostics |
| **Git** (diff, log, status) | Preserves structure, strips noise |
| **Linters** (eslint, clippy, pylint) | Summarizes findings |
| **ANSI codes** | Stripped from all output |

This saves significant context window space on verbose command output while preserving all actionable information.

## Installation

### From npm

```bash
pi install npm:pi-hashline-readmap
```

### From git

```bash
pi install git:github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap
```

### From a local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap.git
cd pi-hashline-readmap
npm install
pi install .
```

## Configuration

No configuration required. The extension registers its tools on load and hooks bash output filtering automatically.

To see bash compression savings, set the environment variable:

```bash
PI_RTK_SAVINGS=1 pi
```

## Development

```bash
npm install          # install dependencies
npm test             # run the test suite
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript type check
```
